This project addresses Problem Statement PS000172 from ISROâ€™s Space Applications Centre, developing an AI-based HelpBot for MOSDAC to enhance information retrieval via natural language interaction. It tackles challenges like information overload, navigation complexity, and technical terminology using Automated Information Retrieval, NLP (BERT/GPT), Context Awareness, and Self-Learning.  

The architecture includes Web Scraper & Indexing, NLP Query Processing, RAG-based retrieval, Falcon-40B for response generation, and API integration. Optimized with QLoRA, scheduled crawlers, and Pinecone vector search, it ensures fast, accurate responses. Technologies used include React.js, Flask, Selenium, PostgreSQL, and Hugging Face Transformers. The project enhances user experience, accessibility, and efficiency while maintaining high performance, accuracy, and scalability.
