Key Existing Innovations:

1.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Lewis et al. (2020) pioneered combining information retrieval with language models, now enhanced with vector embeddings for improved semantic search.

2.Domain-Specific QA Systems:
    NASA's Earth Science Knowledge Graph
    ESA's EO Assistant
    JAXA's Data Discovery Tool

3.Model Efficiency Technologies:
    QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023): Reduces memory requirements while maintaining performance
    Model distillation techniques for deployment optimization

The proposed MOSDAC HelpBot integrates these technologies with domain-specific optimizations for satellite data retrieval, representing a synthesis of current best practices in AI-based information systems.
