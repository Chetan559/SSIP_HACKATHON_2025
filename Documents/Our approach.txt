Our approach combines modern AI techniques with efficient information retrieval to create a responsive, accurate helpbot for the MOSDAC portal:

1.Data Acquisition Pipeline
    Implement scheduled web crawlers to index MOSDAC content (pages, PDFs, tables)
    Convert all content to vector embeddings using domain-tuned BERT models
    Store in Pinecone vector database for efficient retrieval
2.Query Processing System
    Apply NLP preprocessing to understand user intent and extract key entities
    Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the most relevant documents
    Maintain conversation context through session memory for follow-up questions
3.Response Generation
    Deploy QLoRA-optimized Falcon-40B model to reduce resource requirements
    Fine-tune on satellite data terminology and MOSDAC-specific content
    Implement citation mechanisms to reference original sources
4.Performance Optimization
    Use parallel processing for embedding generation and retrieval
    Implement caching for frequently requested information
    Apply quantization techniques to reduce inference time to 5-6 seconds
5.User Experience Enhancement
    Design intuitive chat interface with React.js frontend and Flask backend
    Implement progressive information disclosure (core answers first, details on request)
    
This approach balances technical performance with usability while addressing the specific challenges of satellite data retrieval and technical information accessibility.
