Our approach integrates modern AI techniques with efficient retrieval to create a responsive HelpBot for MOSDAC:  

1. Data Acquisition Pipeline
Schedule web crawlers to index MOSDAC content (pages, PDFs, tables).  
Convert content to vector embeddings using domain-tuned BERT models.  
Store in Pinecone for efficient retrieval.  

2.Query Processing System 
Apply NLP preprocessing to extract key entities and user intent.  
Use RAG with the most relevant documents.  
Maintain conversation context for follow-ups.  

3.Response Generation
Deploy QLoRA-optimized Falcon-40B for reduced resource use.  
Fine-tune on satellite data and MOSDAC content.  
Implement citations for source references.  

4.Performance Optimization
Use parallel processing for embedding and retrieval.  
Implement caching and quantization to reduce response time.  

5.User Experience Enhancement
Design an intuitive React.js frontend with Flask backend.  
Use progressive disclosure for better readability.
