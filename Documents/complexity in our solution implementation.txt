1.Restricted Data Access:
Many datasets on MOSDAC are not openly available, which limits the chatbotâ€™s ability to fetch real-time information. Workarounds like web scraping may not be feasible due to access restrictions.
2.Handling Large-Scale Queries:
Managing concurrent users with fast responses requires caching and vector indexing.
3.Data Freshness:
Since MOSDAC updates its content periodically, ensuring that the chatbot fetches and indexes the latest information without excessive latency is a challenge.
4.Complex Query Interpretation:
Understanding satellite-related queries demands resource-intensive NLP fine-tuning.
5.Deployment and Resource Constraints:
Hosting a large AI model like Falcon with RAG requires significant computational resources, making cost-effective deployment difficult.
6.Context Retention for Multi-Turn Conversations:
Maintaining user context across multiple queries without degrading performance is technically challenging.
