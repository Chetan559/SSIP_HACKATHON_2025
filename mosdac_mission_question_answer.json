The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.\nA passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The detectors temperature is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler is also to maintain the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K."

        "answer": "The satellite has 3 payloads:\nMeteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER\nData Relay Transponder (DRT)\nSatellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R)\nMeteorological Payload\nThe INSAT-3D spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.\nIMAGER\nThe INSAT-3D imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.\nThe Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.\nThis new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.\nKey Parameters of the Imager\nTelescope aperture 310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 Âµm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 Âµm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 Âµm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 Âµm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 Âµm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 Âµm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared)\nSpatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2\nBand separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 Âµrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 Âµrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 Âµrad for WV (8 km)\nSampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV\nScan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 ÂµR step size)\nLine step 224 Âµrad in N-S direction\nScan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200Âº/s +0.2 s turnaround time\n56 ÂµR (peak to peak)\nFull aperture blackbody and spaceview\nScan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity\nFrame time 25 minutes for normal mode\nSignal quantization 10 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s\nSOUNDER\nThe INSAT-3D sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.\nThe Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.\nKey Parameters of the sounder\nTelescope aperture 310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6) 18 Infrared + 1 Visible\nBand definition Filter wheel with interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 280 Âµrad x 280 rad, corresponding to 10 km x 10 km on the surface\nSampling interval 280 Âµrad E-W / N-S\nNo of simultaneous soundings 4 per band\nScan step angle 10 km E-W, every 0.1 s, and 40 km N-S after completion of E-W scan, 150 ÂµR rms\nStep and dwell time 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 s\nTurnaround time 0.1 s per scan\nIn-flight calibration Full aperture blackbody and space view\nScan modes Options provided to cater to quick dynamic environmental phenomena\nFrame time 160 minutes for 6000 km x 6000 km area sounding\nSignal quantization 13 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate 40 kbit/s\nFrame time 90 kg, (without cooler), 100 W\nSpectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder\nBand No. Center wavelength Âµm (cm-1) Bandwidth Âµm (cm-1) NEDT at 300 K (typical) K\n1 14.71 (680) 0.281 (13) 1.5\n2 14.37 (696) 0.268 (13) 1\n3 14.06 (711) 0.256 (13) 0.5\n4 13.96 (733) 0.298 (16) 0.5\n5 13.37 (749) 0.286 (16) 0.5\n6 12.66 (790) 0.481 (30) 0.3\n7 12.02 (832) 0.723 (50) 0.15\n8 11.03 (907) 0.608 (50) 0.15\n9 9.71 (1030) 0.235 (25) 0.2\n10 7.43 (1425) 0.304 (55) 0.2\n11 7.02 (1425) 0.394 (80) 0.2\n12 6.51 (1535) 0.255 (60) 0.2\n13 4.57 (2188) 0.048 (23) 0.2\n14 4.52 (2210) 0.047 (23) 0.15\n15 4.45 (2245) 0.045 (23) 0.15\n16 4.13 (2420) 0.0683 (40) 0.15\n17 3.98 (2513) 0.0683 (40) 0.15\n18 3.74 (2671) 0.140 (100) 0.15\n19 0.695 (14367) 0.05 (1000) (0.67-0.72)   0.1% albedo\n  Communication Payload\n  Communication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services.

The spacecraft has a launch mass of 2211 kg with a dry mass of 907 kg. It is in Geostationary orbit, altitude of ~35, 786 km, location at 74Â° East. The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.\nA passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The temperature of the detectors is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler also maintains the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K."

        "answer": "The satellite has 3 payloads:\nMeteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER\nData Relay Transponder (DRT)\nSatellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R)\nMeteorological Payload\nThe INSAT-3DR spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.\nIMAGER\nThe INSAT-3DR imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.\nThe Imager is an improved design of VHRR-2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.\nThis new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. The INSAT-3DR Imager payload is a replica of INSAT-3D Imager.\nKey Parameters of the Imager\nTelescope aperture 310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6) 0.52 - 0.72 Âµm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 Âµm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 Âµm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 Âµm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 Âµm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 Âµm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared)\nSpatial resolution 1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2\nBand separation, band definition Beam splitter, interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 28 Âµrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 Âµrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 Âµrad for WV (8 km)\nSampling interval 1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV\nScan step angle Linear in E-W direction (8 ÂµR step size)\nLine step 224 Âµrad in N-S direction\nScan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration 200Âº/s +0.2 s turnaround time\n56 ÂµR (peak to peak)\nFull aperture blackbody and spaceview\nScan modes Full, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity\nFrame time 25 minutes for normal mode\nSignal quantization 10 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate 4.0 Mbit/s\nSOUNDER\nThe INSAT-3DR sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands alongwith one visible band. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional maps of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.\nThe Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount. The INSAT-3DR Sounder payload is a replica of INSAT-3D Sounder.\nKey Parameters of the sounder\nTelescope aperture 310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6) 18 Infrared + 1 Visible\nBand definition Filter wheel with interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) 280 Âµrad x 280 rad, corresponding to 10 km x 10 km on the surface\nSampling interval 280 Âµrad E-W / N-S\nNo of simultaneous soundings 4 per band\nScan step angle 10 km E-W, every 0.1 s, and 40 km N-S after completion of E-W scan, 150 ÂµR rms\nStep and dwell time 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 s\nTurnaround time 0.1 s per scan\nIn-flight calibration Full aperture blackbody and space view\nScan modes Options provided to cater to quick dynamic environmental phenomena\nFrame time 160 minutes for 6000 km x 6000 km area sounding\nSignal quantization 13 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate 40 kbit/s\nFrame time 90 kg, (without cooler), 100 W\nSpectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder\nBand No. Center wavelength Âµm (cm-1) Bandwidth Âµm (cm-1) NEDT at 300 K (typical) K\n1 14.71 (680) 0.281 (13) 1.5\n2 14.37 (696) 0.268 (13) 1\n3 14.06 (711) 0.256 (13) 0.5\n4 13.96 (733) 0.298 (16) 0.5\n5 13.37 (749) 0.286 (16) 0.5\n6 12.66 (790) 0.481 (30) 0.3\n7 12.02 (832) 0.723 (50) 0.15\n8 11.03 (907) 0.608 (50) 0.15\n9 9.71 (1030) 0.235 (25) 0.2\n10 7.43 (1425) 0.304 (55) 0.2\n11 7.02 (1425) 0.394 (80) 0.2\n12 6.51 (1535) 0.255 (60) 0.2\n13 4.57 (2188) 0.048 (23) 0.2\n14 4.52 (2210) 0.047 (23) 0.15\n15 4.45 (2245) 0.045 (23) 0.15\n16 4.13 (2420) 0.0683 (40) 0.15\n17 3.98 (2513) 0.0683 (40) 0.15\n18 3.74 (2671) 0.140 (100) 0.15\n19 0.695 (14367) 0.05 (1000) (0.67-0.72)   0.1% albedo\n Communication Payload\nCommunication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2211kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.

        "question": "What is megha tropiques introduction?",
        "answer": "The tropical belt receives more energy from Sun than it radiates back into space. The excess energy is transported to temperate regions by the motion of atmosphere and oceans. Any variation in the energy budget of the tropics will therefore effect the whole planet. The energy exchanges are strongly linked to the water cycle and particularly to the tropical connective systems: huge amount of latent heat are released in the tropical rains, while high humidity and thick clouds strongly affect the radiation budget. Many interactions between radiation, water vapour, clouds, precipitation and atmospheric motion determine the life cycle of convective cloud systems, and the occurrence of extreme events like tropical cyclones, monsoons, flood and droughts. Due to dynamic nature of above parameters, the frequency of observation from low orbiting sun-synchronous orbits is inadequate. Only geo-stationary satellites allow continuous monitoring of the Tropics, but their Vis-IR sensors give limited information on the cloud surface properties or horizontal distribution of water vapour.\nLow orbiting (~800 km) satellites with low inclinations provide high repetitivity. An inclination at 20 degrees provides 6 observations of each point on the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of ITCZ, the Monsoon systems and the Tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations.\nIn order to meet most of the above requirements, Megha Tropiques has been envisaged which is low earth orbit (LEO) mission. Megha in Sanskrit is â€˜cloudâ€™ and Tropiques in French is â€˜tropicsâ€™. Megha-tropiques Mission is an ISRO-CNES (Indo-French) collaborative programme intended for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics using a satellite platform.\nMegha-Tropiques is a one-tonne satellite which will be operated as part of a joint programme between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Franceâ€²s Centre National dâ€²Etudes Spaciales (CNES). The spacecraft was constructed by ISRO, based around the IRS bus developed for earlier Indian satellites, and carries four instruments which will be used to study the Earthâ€²s atmosphere.\nISRO is responsible of the system and the satellite. ISRO provides the launcher, the paltform, part of the MADRAS instrument, the GPS receiver and the mission operation center, which will process all the products until level 1. ISRO also performs the integration and test of the MADRAS instrument, of the complete payload and of the satellite.\nCNES provides a support for the system activities, the hyperfrequency part of the MADRAS instrument (MARFEQ) developped under contract by ASTRIUM, and the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments developped by CNES with a support of the LMD, LERMA and CETP laboratories. CNES also provides the data processing algorithms for the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments and participates to the development of the MADRAS data processing algorithms. A data and instruments performances expertise center will be created in France. For the French part, the level 2 and upper data processing will be realised in the thematic center Icare.\nMegha Tropiques Ground Segment\nThe ground segment is divided into:\n1. A satellite operation ground segment providedby India: \n    an S-band telemetry and command station\n    a satellite monitoring and control center\n2. A science ground segment including Indian and French parts:\n    an S-band mission station for payload telemetry located in India\n    a mission operation center located in India\n    a level-2 processing center in India such as MOSDAC\n    a level-2 processing center named ICARE in France\nThe Megha-Tropiques satellite is launched by an Indian PSLV launcher in 2011, on a 867 km orbit with an inclination of 20Â°. https://www.mosdac.gov.in/images/grnd-seg.JPG"

It is necessary to measure the above parameters for a minimum duration of 3 years in order to observe the inter-annual variability and getting an opportunity to observe El Nino-type events in the tropics.\nThe satellite is launched into a non-sun synchronous orbit, unlike other IRS spacecraft. This Megha-Tropiques satellite carries four payloads namely, MADRAS-a microwave imager, SAPHIR-scanning radiometer instrument, SCARAB-scanner for radiative budget and GPS occultation receiver for atmospheric studies. The major orbit parameters are:\nAltitude: 867 km, circular\nInclination: 20Â°\nPeriod: 102.16 minutes\nRepetitivity: 97 orbits in 7 days\nNo. of Orbits Per day: 14 (approx.) <table cellpadding=\"5px\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"3993F7\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Altitude:</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">867 km, circular</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Inclination:</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">20Â°</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Period:</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">102.16 minutes</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Repetitivity:</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">97 orbits in 7 days</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">No. of Orbits Per day:</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">14 (approx.)</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

        "answer": "Megha-Tropiques carries the following four payloads:\nMicrowave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS), an Imaging Radiometer developed jointly by CNES and ISRO\nSounder for Probing Vertical Profiles of Humidity (SAPHIR), from CNES\nScanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB), from CNES\nRadio Occultation Sensor for Vertical Profiling of Temperature and Humidity (ROSA), procured from Italy\nMADRAS (Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures)\nMADRAS system is a five channel, self calibrating, microwave radiometer system. The radiometer is designed to estimate atmospheric water parameters and wind speed in the equatorial belt. The choice of the channels has been driven by their potential contribution to the measurement of the parameters defined above.\nGeophysical Parameters\nRainfall\nCloud Ice Content\nWind Speed\nTotal Precipitable Water\nCloud Liquid Water\nChannel No. Frequency Pol NEÎ”T Spatial Resolution\nM1 18.7 GHz H+V 0.5 K 40km\nM2 23.8 GHz V 0.5 K 40km\nM3 36.5 GHz H+V 0.5 K 40km\nM4 89 GHz H+V 1.0 K 10km\nM5 157 GHz H+V 1.0 K 6km\n  SAPHIR microwave humidity sounder and radiometer\nThe mission specifications call for determination of humidity with an accuracy of 10 to 20 percent in 5 to 7 layers of the troposphere, over 10 km pixels. For realizing that performance, it is necessary to choose channels for which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the troposphere. This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour by channels more or less close to the centre of the line. A candidate line, already chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz. It is possible to get contribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km.up to 10 to 12 km in tropical redundant to use more than 5 channels. A sixth complimentary channel in a window regions has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lowest channels; the 150 channel of MADRAS can be used for that. This is the principle of SAPHIR instrument, which has been studied in the frame of micro satellites.\nGeophysical Parameters\nHumidity Profile\nChannel No. Centre Frequencies(GHz) Max.

        "answer": "Indian Space Research Organisation launched SCATSAT-1 for ocean and weather related studies and seven co-passenger satellites into polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO) on September 26, 2016. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, in its 37th flight, (PSLV-C35) launched the satellites at 9:12 hours on September 26, 2016 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The 377 kg SCATSAT-1 satellite have satellites from Algeria, Canada and USA, as well as two satellites from Indian Universities as its co-passengers. SCATSAT-1 is placed into a 720 km Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit, whereas the two Universities' satellites and the five foreign satellites are placed into a 670 km polar orbit. This PSLV mission is unique in itself as it is for the first time that its payloads are placed into two different orbits. PSLV-C35 launched from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of Satish Dhawan Space Centre and is the 15th flight of PSLV in 'XL' configuration (with the use of solid strap-on motors). https://www.mosdac.gov.in/images//scatsat_intro.jpeg"

        "answer": "The scientific payload contains the Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) instrument.\nScanning Scatterometer (SCAT)\nSCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at SAC/ISRO, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 25 x 25 km. The parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.900 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.600 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.\nParameter Inner beam Outer beam\nOrbital altitude 720 km\nInstrument frequency 13.515 GHz (Ku-band)\nWind speed range 3-30 m/s, accuracy of 1.8 m/s (rms) or 10%\nWind direction 00 to 3600, accuracy of 200 rms\nWind vector cell size (resolution) 25 km x 25 km grid\nPolarization HH VV\nSwath width 1400 km 1840 km\nScanning circle radius 700 km 920 km\nScanning rate 20.5 rpm https://www.mosdac.gov.in/images/scatsat_scat.jpeg <table style=\"text-align: center;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5px\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"9EC2F8\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Parameter</td>\n<td>Inner beam</td>\n<td>Outer beam</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orbital altitude</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">720 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instrument frequency</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">13.515 GHz (Ku-band)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wind speed range</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">3-30 m/s, accuracy of 1.8 m/s (rms) or 10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wind direction</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">0<sup>0</sup> to 360<sup>0</sup>, accuracy of 20<sup>0</sup> rms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wind vector cell size (resolution)</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">25 km x 25 km grid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polarization</td>\n<td>HH</td>\n<td>VV</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Swath width</td>\n<td>1400 km</td>\n<td>1840 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scanning circle radius</td>\n<td>700 km</td>\n<td>920 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scanning rate</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">20.5 rpm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management.\nMetsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a liftâ€“off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries."

        "answer": "Kalpana-1 is the first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by Indian Space Research Organisation using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on 2002-09-12. This was the first satellite launched by the PSLV into the Geo-stationary orbit. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. On February 5, 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla?a NASA astronaut who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.\nThe satellite features a Very High Resolution scanning Radiometer (VHRR), for three-band images and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) payload.\nSo far, meteorological services had been combined with telecommunication and television services in the INSAT series. MetSat-1 is a precursor to the future INSAT system that will have separate satellites for meteorology and telecommunication & broadcasting services."

        "answer": "The MetSat-1 spacecraft was developed by ISAC (ISRO Satellite Center), Bangalore. MetSat has been designed using a new spacecraft bus (I-1000 bus) employing lightweight structural elements like CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic). A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle.\nStructural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components.\nMetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control).\nThe propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters.\nEPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells. The solar panel features a drive mechanism to point it into the sun. A single NiCd battery (18 Ah capacity) provides power for eclipse phases. The SADA (Solar Array Driver Assembly) slip rings and drive mechanism are modified to meet the power transfer and drive requirements, it is mass-optimized.\nThe spacecraft has a launch mass of 1055 kg including 560 kg of propellant (495 kg S/C dry mass). MetSat-1 has a design life of 7 years with an operational goal of 10 years."

        "answer": "VHRR\nVHRR/2 is a modified version of the VHRR heritage imagers flown on INSAT-2A, -2B, and -2E. The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes:\nFull frame mode (20Â° North-South x 20Â° East-West), minimum in about 33 minutes covering the entire Earth disk\nNormal frame mode (14Â° N-S x 20Â° E-W), minimum in about 23 minutes\nSector frame mode in which the sector can be positioned anywhere in steps of 0.5Â° in the N-S direction to cover 4.5Â° N-S x 20Â° E-W. This mode is particularly suited for rapid, repetitive coverage during severe weather conditions like a cyclone.\nThe nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45Â° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously.\nThe visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).\nImaging modes of the VHRR instrument\nImaging mode Coverage Repeatability\nFull scan 20Â° N-S and 20Â° E-W 33 min\nNormal scan 14Â° N-S and 20Â° E-W 23 min\nSector scan 4.5Â° N-S and 20Â° E-W 23 (3 times)\nImaging modes of the VHRR instruments\n  Channel No of detectors MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) Dynamic range Noise performance\nVIS 4 +4 redundant > 0.23 approx. 0-100% albedo 6 : 1 min at 2.5% albedo\nWater Vapor (WV) 1 + 1 redundant > 0.21 approx. 4-340 K 0.25 K at 300 K\nTIR 1 + 1 redundant > 0.21 approx. 4-320 K 0.5 K at 300 K\n  Schematic illustration of the VHRR instrument\nVHRR Instrument\nSpectral band: VIS\nSpectral band: TIR\nSpectral band: MWIR (Water vapor) 0.55 - 0.75 Âµm; Integrated out-of-band response <3%\nInter detector mismatch < 5% 10.5 - 12.5 Âµm; Integrated out-of-band response <3%\nOut-of-band response peak < 0.1% 5.7 - 7.1 Âµm\nSpatial resolution VIS\nSpatial resolution TIR and MWIR 56 Âµrad (or 2 km x 2 km)\n224 Âµrad (or 8 km x 8 km)\nRadiometric performance: SNR\nRadiometric performance: NEDT > 6 for VIS at 2.5% albedo\n< 0.25 K at 300 K for IR channel\nDynamic range of TIR/MWIR channels\nDynamic range of VIS channel 4-340 K\n0-100%\nMisregistration between VIS and IR <56 Âµrad\nModulation Transfer Function (MTF) > 21% for IR and TIR; >23% for VIS channel\nDRT (Data Relay Transponder)\nThe DRT (Data Relay Transponder) is part of a DCS (Data Collection System) of ISRO. The objective is to collect data from unattended meteorological platforms in the ground segment. DRT receives receives signals from unattended weather data collection platforms and retransmits them to the central station. The data from these payloads are being used for comprehensive weather status and forecasting.\nRF communication of DRT: Uplink frequency = 402.75 MHz; downlink frequency = 4506.05 MHz; bandwidth =Â± 100 kHz; EIRP = 21 dBW (min).\nNote: MetSat-1 does not carry SAS&R (Satellite Aided Search and Rescue) system. In the INSAT-2 series, the INSAT-2A and -2B satellites carried SAS&R transponders as well as DRTs (Data Relay Transponders). According to ISRO information, INSAT-3A (launch April 9, 2003) and INSAT-3D (to be launched subsequently), will carry SAS&R and DRT payloads. https://www.mosdac.gov.in/images/vhrr_imaging_modes.JPG <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Imaging mode</th>\n<th>Coverage</th>\n<th>Repeatability</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full scan</td>\n<td>20Â° N-S and 20Â° E-W</td>\n<td>33 min</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal scan</td>\n<td>14Â° N-S and 20Â° E-W</td>\n<td>23 min</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sector scan</td>\n<td>4.5Â° N-S and 20Â° E-W</td>\n<td>23 (3 times)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table> <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Channel</th>\n<th>No of detectors</th>\n<th>MTF (Modulation Transfer Function)</th>\n<th>Dynamic range</th>\n<th>Noise performance</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VIS</td>\n<td>4 +4 redundant</td>\n<td>&gt; 0.23 approx.</td>\n<td>0-100% albedo</td>\n<td>6 : 1 min at 2.5% albedo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Water Vapor (WV)</td>\n<td>1 + 1 redundant</td>\n<td>&gt; 0.21 approx.</td>\n<td>4-340 K</td>\n<td>0.25 K at 300 K</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TIR</td>\n<td>1 + 1 redundant</td>\n<td>&gt; 0.21 approx.</td>\n<td>4-320 K</td>\n<td>0.5 K at 300 K</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table> <table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Spectral band: VIS<br> Spectral band: TIR<br> Spectral band: MWIR (Water vapor)</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">0.55 - 0.75 Âµm; Integrated out-of-band response &lt;3% <br> Inter detector mismatch &lt; 5% 10.5 - 12.5 Âµm; Integrated out-of-band response &lt;3%<br> Out-of-band response peak &lt; 0.1% 5.7 - 7.1 Âµm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spatial resolution VIS <br> Spatial resolution TIR and MWIR</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">56 Âµrad (or 2 km x 2 km)<br> 224 Âµrad (or 8 km x 8 km)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Radiometric performance: SNR<br> Radiometric performance: NEDT</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">&gt; 6 for VIS at 2.5% albedo<br> &lt; 0.25 K at 300 K for IR channel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic range of TIR/MWIR channels<br> Dynamic range of VIS channel</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">4-340 K<br> 0-100%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Misregistration between VIS and IR</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">&lt;56 Âµrad</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">&gt; 21% for IR and TIR; &gt;23% for VIS channel</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

        "answer": "SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc"

        "answer": "SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations.\nSARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time.\nThus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission.\nThe AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation.\nThe SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1.\nBy ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description:\nFor the meso-scale in open ocean,,\nIn coastal areas,\nFor the seasonal forecast,\nFor the hydrology,\nFor the climate studies.\nAltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc."

        "answer": "SARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is to provide data products to oceanographic research user community in studies leading to improve our knowledge of the ocean meso-scale variability, thanks to the improvement in spatial and vertical resolution brought by SARAL/AltiKa.\nOcean meso-scale variability is defined as a class of high-energy processes, with wave lengths within a 50km to 500km range, and with periods of a few days to one year. Kinetic energy of mesoscale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation's one. Description of mesoscale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic effects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow).\nSARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is divided in sub-themes including:\nIntrinsic scientific studies of ocean at meso-scale dynamics: observations, theoretical analyses, modelling, data assimilation, parameterization, ...\nImprovement of our understanding of the oceanic component in the climate system: investigation of local processes at small or medium scale poorly known and understood at present, but which have an impact on the modelling of climate variability at large spatial and temporal scales.\nContribution to the study of coastal dynamic processes, especially small or medium scale phenomena, whose retrieval will enable to anticipate many downstream applications.\nContribution to operational oceanography which is seeking large amounts of in situ and space observation data.\nSARAL/AltiKa secondary objectives are notably the monitoring of the main continental waters level (lakes, rivers, closed seas), the monitoring of mean sea level variations, the observation of polar oceans, the analysis and forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to improved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in counterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry (notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics)."

        "answer": "The scientific payload contains three instruments. Two are Indian and one is from the Italian Space Agency.\nOcean Colour Monitor (OCM)\nScanning Scatterometer (SCAT)\nRadio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA)\nOcean Colour Monitor (OCM)\nOCM is an 8-band multi-spectral camera operating in the Visible and Near IR spectral range. This camera provides an instantaneous geometric field of view of 360 meter and a swath of 1420 km. OCM can be tilted up to + 20 degree along track.\nScanning Scatterometer (SCAT)\nSCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.900 and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.600 on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.\nRadio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA)\nROSA is a new GPS occultation receiver provided by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The objective is to characterize the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, opening the possibilities for the development of several scientific activities exploiting these new radio occultation data sets.\n "
